  <p class="pop">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. <br> It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, <br> making it over 2000 years old.  Richard McClintock, <br> a Latin professor  at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, <br> looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, <br> from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites <br>   of the word in classical literature, discovered the <br> undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes <br> from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" <br> (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. <br> This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, <br> very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum,<br> "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section <br> 1.10.32.

The <br> standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below <br> for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de <br> Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also <br> reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English <br> versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>
